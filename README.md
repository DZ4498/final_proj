**Final Project: AdaBoost Algorithm Implementation and Testing**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)** algorithm from scratch using Python. The code trains multiple weak classifiers and combines them to form a powerful ensemble model capable of achieving robust classification results. Both the core implementation and a demonstration notebook are included.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Implementation**: Clear class structures for both the `AdaBoost` ensemble and the `DecisionStump` weak classifier.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Easily adjust the number of estimators and other hyperparameters to explore their effects on performance.
- **Synthetic Data Testing**: Simple test datasets generated on the fly to validate functionality and measure performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots the decision boundary for a visual understanding of how AdaBoost separates classes.

## Files
- `final_proj.ipynb`: An interactive Jupyter notebook showcasing the training process, predictions, and visualization.
- `final_project.pdf`: A compiled PDF report containing a detailed explanation of AdaBoost, its mathematical principles, code implementation details, and results.
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information for this repository.
- `output_0_1.png`: Sample output image from the decision boundary visualization.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DZ4498/final_proj.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed. If a `requirements.txt` is provided, run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**  
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook final_proj.ipynb
    ```

**Performance**  
- **Accuracy**: The example synthetic dataset achieves test accuracy consistently above 80%.  
- **Model Behavior**: Observe how increasing the number of estimators affects classification performance and how misclassified samples influence subsequent training iterations.

**Next Steps**  
- **Real-World Data**: Integrate AdaBoost with real-world datasets and compare performance with other ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.  
- **Complex Weak Classifiers**: Experiment with more sophisticated weak learners, such as deeper decision trees or linear models, to potentially improve accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rates, number of estimators, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.
