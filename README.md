**Final Project: AdaBoost Algorithm Implementation and Testing**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)** algorithm from scratch using Python. The code trains multiple weak classifiers and combines them to form a powerful ensemble model capable of achieving robust classification results. Both the core implementation and a demonstration notebook are included.


## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**
